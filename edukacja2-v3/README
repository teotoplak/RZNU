This project containst simple application that demonstrates using
of persistence framework in Play.

Objects of class Student are created and stored in database.
Every Student can be modified on separate page.
There is also relationship between Student and Tag (that describes languages
students speak)
Information from tag relationship is taken into account when displaying
Student edit form.

Two new classes have been added: 
- Course (to keep information about university courses)
- Enrollment (to keep information about enrollments of students in courses)
Courses are displayed in two manners:
- All courses on one page (the same way as students are),
- Splitted into multiple pages (each page displays two courses) with navigation
  objects (previous/next page).
